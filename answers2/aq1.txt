**Research Abstract**

A study on the impact of social media on mental health was conducted to explore the relationship between social media use and self-esteem in young adults. The study found that excessive social media use was associated with lower self-esteem, while moderate social media use was positively correlated with self-esteem. These findings suggest that social media can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly among young adults.

**Thesis Statement**

The relationship between social media use and self-esteem in young adults reveals a paradoxical effect: excessive social media use is associated with lower self-esteem, while moderate social media use is positively correlated with self-esteem. This study contributes to the existing body of research on the impact of technology on mental health by exploring the complex interplay between social media use, identity formation, and self-perception.

Title: The Double-Edged Sword of Social Media: Exploring the Relationship Between Social Media Use and Self-Esteem in Young Adults

Abstract:

This study investigates the relationship between social media use and self-esteem in young adults. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected data from 500 participants who reported their social media usage habits and self-reported measures of self-esteem. Our results show that excessive social media use was associated with lower self-esteem, while moderate social media use was positively correlated with self-esteem.

The findings suggest that social media can have a profound impact on mental health, particularly among young adults. While social media provides a platform for self-expression and connection, it also perpetuates unrealistic expectations, promotes comparison, and cultivates feelings of inadequacy. Our study highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between technology use, identity formation, and self-perception.

Keywords: social media, self-esteem, mental health, young adults, technology use, identity formation.
