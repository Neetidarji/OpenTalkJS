In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest stirs, and nature sways.
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their leaves a gentle fold.

The wind whispers secrets in the night,
As stars appear, with all their light.
The moon, a glowing orb of white,
Casts silver paths, through the endless light.

In river's flow, where waters glide,
A world of wonder, side by side.
The fish swim deep, with scales of blue,
Their ripples dance, in perfect hue.

The mountains rise, a towering height,
Their peaks a challenge, to the morning's light.
The air is crisp, with scents so sweet,
As nature awakens, at our feet.

In nature's arms, we find our peace,
A sense of calm, our worries release.
We breathe the air, and listen deep,
To the whispers, of the earth's soft sleep.
