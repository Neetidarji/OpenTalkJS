In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day,
The trees stand tall, their branches sway,
A gentle lullaby to end the day.

The river flows, its waters wide,
A silver ribbon, gliding with pride,
The sun sets low, a fiery ball,
Painting hues of pink and gold at all.

The birds awake, their songs so free,
A chorus loud, for you and me,
Their trills and chirps, a joyful sound,
As nature's beauty is unbound.

The wind stirs leaves, a rustling treat,
A soothing murmur, soft to greet,
The earthy scent, the fresh-cut air,
Invigorating senses, without a care.

In this wild world, where I reside,
I find my peace, my heart inside,
Connected to the land and its might,
A sense of awe, at nature's sight.

So let us cherish, this world we share,
This fragile beauty, beyond compare,
Let us protect, preserve and keep,
For generations yet to sleep.
