Title: Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Water Quality and Ecosystem Services in Urban Drainage Systems

Abstract:

Climate change is projected to significantly impact urban drainage systems, with increasing temperatures and precipitation leading to more frequent and severe flooding events. This study investigates the effects of climate change on water quality and ecosystem services in urban drainage systems, focusing on the following research questions: (1) How do changes in temperature and precipitation affect stormwater runoff and pollutant loads in urban areas? (2) What are the impacts of climate change on the physical and biological properties of urban drainage systems, including their capacity to manage floods and maintain ecosystem services? Using a combination of field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling, this study examines the effects of climate change on water quality and ecosystem services in six different cities worldwide. Our results show that increased temperatures and precipitation lead to significant increases in stormwater runoff and pollutant loads, as well as changes in the physical and biological properties of urban drainage systems. We also find that these changes have severe impacts on ecosystem services, including reduced water quality, decreased biodiversity, and compromised flood resilience. The study highlights the need for integrated management strategies that incorporate climate change projections, spatial analysis, and stakeholder engagement to mitigate the effects of climate change on urban drainage systems and maintain ecosystem services.
